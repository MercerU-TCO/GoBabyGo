## Issues

Issues are tasks and notes that describe aspects of the project that need attention. Basically, items that make up the project's _to-do_ list. The issues for this project are kept in [https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo/issues](https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo/issues).

Issues should be labeled to make them easy to search. The labels used in this project are described here. Each label falls into one of three categories:

* **Descriptive labels** describe the type of issue and are used to organize the labels
* **Process labels** describe where an issue is in a process to keep track of an issue's progress
* **Outcome labels** describe how an issue was closed, if it was not addressed.
* **Size/Scope labels** describes the relative size of the issue.

These are the labels used for issues in this project.
