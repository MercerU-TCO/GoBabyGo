This is a walkthrough for the entire contribution process: from finding an issue through submitting a pull request.

## Finding an Issue

The test version of the Go Baby Go website is located at [Dr. Watson's Personal account](https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo). From there, click the _Issues_ tab.

From there, you can sort the issues via the tags they are associated with. A more detailed description of the tags is available on the issues page [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/docs-contribution/gbg-issues.html).

After selecting an issue, be sure that your chosen issue is not already being worked on by someone else! Type a comment on your issue to let others know that you've claimed it.

Once you've claimed your issue, you are ready to fork the repository.

## Forking the Repo

We highly recommend new users work with the GitHub desktop program. It can be 
downloaded [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

To fork the repository, simply click the fork button in the top right of the 
repository web page.

![Fork]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/fork-button.PNG)

Once this is done, you will have a copy of the repository tied to your account. 
From here, you can clone the repository and begin work.

Click here to clone the repository to your computer. You will be using the URL
in the box in the middle.

![Website Clone]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/clone-button.PNG)

Then, on GitHub desktop, perform the following to finish setting up your local 
repository.

![Desktop clone]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gh-desktop-clone.PNG)

## Making Changes

To make changes, edit or create files that correspond with the section you are 
attempting to correct. Then, add the files to a 'commit' like this:

![Commit]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gh-desktop-commit.PNG)

Once you are finished with this, you're ready to submit your changes. 

## Submitting Changes

To submit changes, click the "Push" changes button on the top bar.

![Push]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gh-desktop-push.PNG)

This will update the online version of your repository.

## Submitting Pull Requests  

When you are finished with the issue you've chosen to solve, you can submit a 
pull request to Dr. Watson's repository.

![Pull Request]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/fork-button.PNG)

You will then be given the opportunity to compare your changes, and complete the
 pull request.
**Make sure that you are pulling from your personal repository to 
Dr. Watson's!**

![Comparing Changes]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/comparing-changes.PNG)

You will then be able to title and write a description of the changes your 
repository makes. Once finished with that, click submit and you're done.

Thanks for helping the Go Baby Go project!
