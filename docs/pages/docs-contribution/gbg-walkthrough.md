This is a walkthrough for the entire contribution process: from finding an issue through submitting a pull request.

## Finding an Issue

The test version of the Go Baby Go website is located at [Dr. Watson's Personal account](https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo). From there, click the _Issues_ tab.

From there, you can sort the issues via the tags they are associated with. A more detailed description of the tags is available on the issues page [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/docs-contribution/gbg-issues.html).

After selecting an issue, be sure that your chosen issue is not already being worked on by someone else! Type a comment on your issue to let others know that you've claimed it.

Once you've claimed your issue, you are ready to fork the repository.

## Forking the Repo

We highly recommend new users work with the GitHub desktop program. It can be downloaded [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

To fork the repository, simply click the fork button in the top right of the repository web page.

Once this is done, you will have a copy of the repository tied to your account. From here, you can clone the repository and begin work.

Click here to clone the repository to your computer.
![Website Clone]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/clone-button.PNG)

Then, on GitHub desktop, perform the following to finish setting up your local repository.
![Desktop clone]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gh-desktop-clone.PNG)

## Making Changes

To make changes, edit or create files that correspond with the section you are attempting to correct. Then, add the files to a 'commit' like this:

![Commit]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gh-desktop-commit.PNG)

Once you are finished with this, you're ready to submit your changes. 

## Submitting Changes

To submit changes, click the "Push" changes button on the top bar.

![Push]({{site.baseurll}}/assets/images/gh-desktop-push.PNG)

This will update the online version of your repository.

## Submitting Pull Requests  

When you are finished with the issue you've chosen to solve, you can submit a pull request to Dr. Watson's repository.

![Pull Request]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/fork-button.PNG)

You will then be given the opportunity to compare your changes, and complete the pull request.
**Make sure that you are pulling from your personal repository to Dr. Watson's!**
![Comparing Changes]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/comparing-changes.PNG)

You will then be able to title and write a description of the changes your repository makes. Once finished with that, click submit and you're done.

Thanks for helping the Go Baby Go project!
