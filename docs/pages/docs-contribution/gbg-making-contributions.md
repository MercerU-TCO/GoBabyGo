## Making Contributions

After you create or modify the files in your forked repo, to contribute those changes to the project:

1. **Make sure that you can see those changes in your version of the github.io documentation.** <br>
This is very important. If you can't see your changes, something went wrong and **you must fix it before you continue!**
    1. The first place to look is to make sure you do not have any bad metadatain a file.
    1. The next place to look is to make sure you didn't link an image wrong.
    2. If you still don't see your changes, you'll need to ask for help.
1. If you see your changes in your version of the github.io documentation (i.e. at the link in your repo's **Settings** tab, in the **GitHub Pages** box in the **Options** view), you can continue.
1. Send your pull request to the [https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo](https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo) repo.
	1. Create a **New pull request** <br>

1. If your contribution looks good, it will be merged into the staging repo and eventually make its way to the published project.
1. If there's a problem, you might get some questions about the pull request or it might be declined with a comment to help you fix it. After you fix whatever wasn't working, repeat these steps to resubmit your pull request.
