Wire the button on the steering wheel

_This task is easier with two people._

_Note that this is only required for cars that will be operated by hand._

## Procedure

**UPDATE: Do not attach the capacitor--it is no longer needed.**

1. Locate the 16" 18-ga duplex wire and remove the foil shielding from both ends.
2. Remove 3" of gray sheath from wire.
3. Remove foil and bare wire to end of gray sheath.
4. On one end of the 16" 18-ga duplex wire:
	5. Use the wire cutters to cut the black wire 3/8" shorter than the red wire.
	6. Use the [wire strippers](https://youtu.be/znljircthKs) to remove 1/4" of insulation from the red wire and the black wire.	
	8. Use the crimp tool to [crimp](https://youtu.be/znWw6qUWQW0) a red , female terminal to the longer wire.
	8. Use the crimp tool to [crimp](https://youtu.be/znWw6qUWQW0) a red, female terminal to the shorter wires.
	9. Test the connectors that you just attached by gently pulling on them. They should not slip off.
10. On the other end of the 16" 18-ga duplex wire:
	1. Remove 1/4" of insulation from each of the red and the black wires.
	2. Twist the strands of each of the bare wires to keep them together. **Do not twist the red and black wires together.**
10. Locate the switch you removed from the push button.
11. Refer to the photo to see how the switch will look when you finish these steps:
	1. Locate the terminal closest to the black extrusion and bend it down, towards the black extrusion.
	2. Cover the bent terminal with [black vinyl electrical tape](https://youtu.be/YtZQfntDxcY).<br>![Switch assembly prepared]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task07-002.jpg)
11. Connect the end with the [crimp](https://youtu.be/znWw6qUWQW0)ed terminals to the switch:
	1. Connect the [crimp](https://youtu.be/znWw6qUWQW0)ed terminal attached to the red wire to the metal terminal on the switch that is farthest from the black extrusion.
	2. Connect the crimped terminal attached to the black wire to the metal terminal that is next to the taped terminal.
15. Replace the switch in the push button by:
	1. Inserting the switch with the wires oriented along the center spoke of the steering wheel.
	2. Orient the switch about 1/8 of a turn to the left of center.
	3. Gently push the switch into the push button and rotate 1/8 of a turn clockwise.
	4. The switch should snap into place.
	5. Gently pull on the switch body to see if it comes out. If so, try to insert it again.

## Verification

Use the multimeter to test the wiring.

[Short video on using the multimeter to measure continuity](https://youtu.be/x3cjTQxXr0g)

1. On the multimeter, select "Ohms" (or continuity). This is usually indicated by the Greek letter omega (&#937;) for Ohms.

2. Place the red lead of the meter on the bare wire of the red wire.
3. Place the black lead of the meter on the bare wire of the black wire.
4. With both leads touching their respective terminals as shown in this photo.

	1. The meter should not show continuity.

	2. Press the large red push button, and the meter should indicate continuity (by showing zero or almost zero ohms or beeping).

After you confirm that the wiring is correct with the multimeter, you can continue to [the next task]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cars-maserati-task08.html).
