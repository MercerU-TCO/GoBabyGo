Disconnect the foot pedal

_This task is easier with two people._

_Note that this is only required for cars that will be operated by hand._

**Make sure that the [battery has been disconnected]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cars-maserati-task03.html "Disconnect the battery") before performing this step** 

## Procedure

1. Turn car upside-down.
2. Locate the foot pedal. <br />![Foot pedal location]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task05-001.jpg)
3. Using a flat-tip screwdriver, push in each of the four gray tabs that hold the foot pedal to the floor.<br />![Foot pedal tabs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task05-002.jpg)<br /> The foot pedal should fall away from the floor after the last tab is pressed.
4. Place the car on its side.
5. One at a time, disconnect each of the wires from the foot pedal by pulling each of the connectors.
6. Remove the screw that holds the foot pedal to the base (#1 in the photo).<br />![Foot pedal assembly]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task05-003.jpg)
5. Refer to the preceding photo. Squeeze the tabs (#2 in the photo) and push the switch out (PUSH) of the gray plastic foot pedal.
6. Replace the pedal and use a \#8 x 3/4" blunt-nosed screw (_not the screw that you removed!!_) to secure the foot pedal to the base.
7. From the underside of the car, pull the wires that were connected to the foot pedal through the bottom of the car.
8. Replace the gray foot pedal in the floor of the car so that all four tabs snap into the floor. You might need to push on the tabs with the flat-tip screwdriver for them to snap into place.
9. Locate the terminals at the end of the cable that was connected to the foot pedal and, one at a time, feed them through the hole with the connectors from the dashboard. <br />This is easier with two people, one on each side of the car.<br />![Foot pedal cable - underside view]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task05-004.jpg)<br />View from under the car.<br /><br />![Foot pedal cable - top view]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task05-005.jpg)<br />View from above the car.<br />
10. When all three terminals are through pull the black cable through the hole
11. Cover the terminal at the end of the red wire with [black vinyl electrical tape](https://youtu.be/YtZQfntDxcY).

## Verification

After you make sure that:

1. The foot pedal does not move.
	- If it moves, you will need to remove the foot-pedal assembly,  secure the pedal with a 9/16" screw, and replace the foot-pedal assembly.
1. The black cable with three terminals is on the top side of the car.
	- If it isn't, you will need to feed the cable through the hole with the dashboard connectors.
2. The terminal on the red wire is covered in [black vinyl electrical tape](https://youtu.be/YtZQfntDxcY).
